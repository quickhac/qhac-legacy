# QuickHAC #

QuickHAC (or qHAC) is a Chrome extension that checks grades from roundrockisd.org. In addition to allowing you to see your overall grades and your class grades, it also supports the following features:

* Automatic updates and notifications for grade changes
* Colorization of grades depending on how bad they are
* Extremely pretty interface designed by mdciotti

## Installing ##

2. In Chrome, click the menu at the top right, select Tools -> Extensions. This will show you a list of all of your installed extensions.
3. Drag and drop the file you downloaded anywhere in the Extensions page.
4. Login and enjoy.
